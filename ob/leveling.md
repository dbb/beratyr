# Beratyr's Oblivion Leveling Guide

## About

This guide is intended as a quick-n-dirty crash course in [Efficient Leveling](http://uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Efficient_Leveling), primarily for beginners, but veterans may find some useful tips as well.

Note: efficient leveling is a challenge in its own right, although the actual gameplay will be much easier afterward. However, it takes a long time, is quite tedious, and **may very well ruin the game for you**. Proceed at your own risk.

## The Leveling system

Once you get `10` skill increases in any of your major skills, you have the option to level up by sleeping. **This means your major skill choices are extremely important.** Note that I said *option*. You can continue to increase your skills before leveling up, which will be important later.

When you level up, your reward is the ability to permanently increase any `3` attributes by `1` to `5` points. The number depends on how many skill increases you got *that level* in the attribute's governing skills. Luck is the exception: it can only be increased by `1`. This variance in attribute bonuses is the entire point of efficient leveling. You *could* actually role-play and try to have fun, but that would *suck* because you'd end up with a weak character. It's much better to end up as a demigod that one-hit anyone in the game, right? 

Here is an attribute-skill reference chart:

Before long, you will likely have all these memorized. But for the time being, keep a copy nearby.

## Character Creation

### Race and gender
Your race isn't extremely important, but it may have some effect on how long it takes you to max out the skills and attributes. Same for gender. I almost always chose a Breton as their magic resistance is the best racial perk.

### Skills
Create a custom class. **Choose major skills that are easy to control.** Choose `1` skill for each governing attribute. I chose the following:

* Blunt (Str)
* Mysticism (Int)
* Alteration (Wlp)
* Security (Agl)
* Acrobatics (Spd)
* Heavy Armor (End)
* Illusion (Spc)

If you don't know what I mean by "easy to control", just stick with these.

As for the specialization, you can pick whatever you want. 

### Attributes

Chose **Endurance** as your first favored attribute. I can't stress this enough. Endurance is the first attribute you'll want to max out as it controls how much health you gain when leveling up.

The second attribute is less important, but consider your character. Mages will likely want to pick Intelligence, rogues Agility, and fighters Strength.

### Birthsign

I always pick **The Lady** for the Endurance bonus.

## Leveling

To level efficiently, you need to keep careful track of your progress. I've made a [handy speadsheet](/link) which makes things easier. At a bare minimum, you need to monitor your skill increases *each level*. I also keep a record of my starting skill values as a reference point in case I screw up the count along the way.

You need to get `10` skill increases in skills governed by the target attribute, as well as `2` additional attributes. That means you need to spread `30` skill increases across `3` attributes.

How you distribute those skills depends on what the skills' starting values are, and how difficult each skill is to increase. **But in general, I use a 3-3-4 formula.** 

Example: let's say I'm targeting End, and I have a Armorer skill of `10`, a Block Skill of `15`, and a Heavy Armor skill of `18`. I would increase Armorer by `4`, and then Block and Heavy Armor by `3`.

You could also do 4-4-2, 5-3-2, or even 10-0-0. The goal is to give more points to the weakest skill, and less to the stringest.

You may have realized a problem: you need 10 skill increases in 3 major skills to level up. You can either split them up as mentioned above, or you can use a "throwaway" skill for the extra point. **Illusion is good for this as personality is the least useful attribute.** Also, once you max out an attribute, all three of its skills become "throwaways", meaning that you can level them whenever you want without having to worry about keeping track (except for the major skill).

## Prioritizing

**Endurance** is the most important attribute, as mentioned ten times already. But for the rest, you need to consider your options.

You can either focus on three attributes until they are completely maxed out then pick three new ones, or you can focus on Endurance and rotate the other two. The second option is less boring and it's what I generally do. Below are some pros and cons to help you decide what to focus on. I have listed them roughly in descending (high to low) priority for my play style, but yours could be completely different.

* Endurance: Top priority. Directly affects **Fatigue**, **Health**, and health increase per level.
* Agility: **Very** useful. Agility affects **bow damage**, so archers should make this a top priority. Also affects **Fatigue** and your chance to avoid being **staggered**.
* Intelligence: A must for mages. Affects your **total magicka**, but *not* the magicka cost of spells.
* Willpower: A must for mages. Affects your **magicka regeneration** as well as **fatigue**.
* Strength: A must for warriors. Affects **melee damage**, **fatigue**, and your total **carry weight**.
* Speed: Fairly useful- they can't kill what they can't catch. Controls **movement speed**, speed of **fast travel**, and length of **jumps**.
* Personality: this is the **LEAST** useful. Speechcraft is easy enough, Mercantile is pretty useless except early on, and **Personality actually has no discernible effect on Illusion spells despite being its governing attribute.** I actually would improve Luck before wasting points on this attribute.

## Skills

**FINALLY**, here are some tips for leveling specific skills, arranged according to their governing attributes.

### Strength Skills

For all three Strength skills (**Blade, Blunt, and Hand to Hand**), you will want to go to [Peryite's Shrine](/link) and go to town on the frozen worshippers there.

#### Blade

Use daggers- they swing faster and you get a set amount of XP for each hit. Keep extra daggers or repair hammers handy.

#### Blunt

Use axes, preferably Iron as they weigh the least.

#### Hand to Hand

This is the *easiest* Strength skill to level. It's also quite handy since you will never *not* have your fists available and they never break.

### Intelligence Skills

#### Alchemy

Alchemy is quite easy to level, and *very* lucrative. In fact, I use the profits from selling potions to pay for training in more difficult skills.

Join the Mages Guild for access to free alchemy equipment and food (by the way, it should go without saying that should take every single ingredient you see, because you can never have too many). You can gather enough free ingredients from farms to make a couple hundred potions, and the real kicker is that the plants respawn after three days.

In order to make a lot of money while maxing out your Intelligence, you may want to to a `7-3` split between Alchemy and Mysticism (or Conjuration if you chose it as a major skill instead).

Note: you only need *one* each of the alembic, calcinator, mortar & pestle, and retort- they do not degrade in condition or break, so you can sell all the extras. Most guild halls will have a respawning cabinet containing alchemy apparatuses.

Also, be sure to periodically check the inventory of alchemy vendors for upgraded equipment (e.g. after your alchemy skill passes 25, you can buy Apprentice equipment and sell your Novice equipment).

#### Conjuration

Hotkey *Summon Skelton*, one or more *Bound [armor]* spells, and *Bound Dagger*. Summon the skeleton, conjure your armor, then repeatedly conjure and sheath the dagger. Once the skeleton and armor disappear, start the process over.

When you run out of magicka, just wait for `1` hour.

Conjuration can be leveled in tandem with other skills. For example, you could attack conjured creatures with bound weapons to level your melee skills, or you could use bound armor when levelling your light armor skill. Just be careful with your counts.

#### Mysticism

Hold the Block button and repeatedly cast the *Minor Detect Life* spell. Mysticism is relatively easy.

### Willpower Skills

#### Alteration

Hold Block and cast the *Protect* (shield 5% on self) spell. Quite easy to level.

#### Destruction

Go to Peryite's Shrine (where you will also be levelling your melee skills) and cast *Flare* on the followers. The *Entropic Touch* spell is actually better, but you'll have to buy it at the Mage's Guild in Skingrad.

#### Restoration

One of the **hardest** skills to level, and certainly the hadest of the magic skills. Hold Block and repeatedly cast the *Minor Respite* spell. I usually only level one point and train for `2`. 

### Agility Skills

### Speed Skills

### Endurance Skills 

####Armorer

This one is a bit tricky as you need *a lot* of repair hammers, which can get expensive later on. Luckily, your shields and heavy armor are going to get damaged while you're leveling the other two Endurance skills, so you'll have something to repair. If you're also leveling strength, you'll have weapons to repair too.

But you will run out of things to use your hammers on, or you will run out of hammers. You may consider **training** (at The Fighting Chance in the Imperial City Market District), or you can **ignore** your Armorer skill until Heavy Armor and Block become painfully slow to level.

Tip: the *respawning* containers in the Market District often contain repair hammers. Actually any "miscellaneous junk" container has a chance to contain hammers (and lockpicks too), so check barrels, crates, boxes, etc. regularly.

#### Block

Just go to a bandit camp and let one of them whale on you- **preferably one with a dagger**. If a bandit has a bow, you can get them to draw a dagger (usually) by attacking them with a melee weapon.

I like to go to the [Cursed Mine](/link) or [Place outside sewers](/link). You can back yourself into a corner then not worry about getting pushed around.

Note: enemies will attack slower/less frequently if your shield is kept up. Thus, it is slightly faster to level block by leaving your shield down and only raising it just before an attack. However, this also requires you to pay attention to the game.

Tip: Heavy armor shields will degrade slower, and iron shields are the lightest available. Carry `2-3` in your inventory unless you have plenty of repair hammers.

#### Heavy Armor

This is the *easiest* Endurange-governed skill to level. Essentially everything said about Block applies here.

### Personality Skills
