# Beratyr's Oblivion Leveling Guide

## About

This guide is intended as a quick-n-dirty crash course in [Efficient Leveling](http://uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Efficient_Leveling), primarily for beginners, but veterans may find some useful tips as well.

Note: efficient leveling is a challenge in its own right, although the actual gameplay will be much easier afterward. However, it takes a long time, is quite tedious, and **may very well ruin the game for you**. Proceed at your own risk.

## The Leveling system

Once you get `10` skill increases in any of your major skills, you have the option to level up by sleeping. **This means your major skill choices are extremely important.** Note that I said *option*. You can continue to increase your skills before leveling up, which will be important later.

When you level up, your reward is the ability to permanently increase any `3` attributes by `1` to `5` points. The number depends on how many skill increases you got *that level* in the attribute's governing skills. Luck is the exception: it can only be increased by `1`. This variance in attribute bonuses is the entire point of efficient leveling. You *could* actually role-play and try to have fun, but that would *suck* because you'd end up with a weak character. It's much better to end up as a demigod that one-hit anyone in the game, right? 

Here is an attribute-skill reference chart:

Before long, you will likely have all these memorized. But for the time being, keep a copy nearby.

## Character Creation

### Race and gender
Your race isn't extremely important, but it may have some effect on how long it takes you to max out the skills and attributes. Same for gender. I almost always chose a Breton as their magic resistance is the best racial perk.

### Skills
Create a custom class. **Choose major skills that are easy to control.** Choose `1` skill for each governing attribute. I chose the following:

* Blunt (Str)
* Mysticism (Int)
* Alteration (Wlp)
* Security (Agl)
* Acrobatics (Spd)
* Heavy Armor (End)
* Illusion (Spc)

If you don't know what I mean by "easy to control", just stick with these.

As for the specialization, you can pick whatever you want. 

### Attributes

Chose **Endurance** as your first favored attribute. I can't stress this enough. Endurance is the first attribute you'll want to max out as it controls how much health you gain when leveling up.

The second attribute is less important, but consider your character. Mages will likely want to pick Intelligence, rogues Agility, and fighters Strength.

### Birthsign

I always pick **The Lady** for the Endurance bonus.
 

## Leveling

To level efficiently, you need to keep careful track of your progress. I've made a [handy speadsheet](/link) which makes things easier. At a bare minimum, you need to monitor your skill increases *each level*. I also keep a record of my starting skill values as a reference point in case I screw up the count along the way.

You need to get `10` skill increases in skills governed by the target attribute, as well as `2` additional attributes. That means you need to spread `30` skill increases across `3` attributes.

How you distribute those skills depends on what the skills' starting values are, and how difficult each skill is to increase. **But in general, I use a 3-3-4 formula.** 

Example: let's say I'm targeting End, and I have a Armorer skill of `10`, a Block Skill of `15`, and a Heavy Armor skill of `18`. I would increase Armorer by `4`, and then Block and Heavy Armor by `3`.

You could also do 4-4-2, 5-3-2, or even 10-0-0. The goal is to give more points to the weakest skill, and less to the stringest.

You may have realized a problem: you need 10 skill increases in 3 major skills to level up. You can either split them up as mentioned above, or you can use a "throwaway" skill for the extra point. **Illusion is good for this as personality is the least useful attribute.** Also, once you max out an attribute, all three of its skills become "throwaways", meaning that you can level them whenever you want without having to worry about keeping track (except for the major skill).

## Prioritizing

**Endurance** is the most important attribute, as mentioned ten times already. But for the rest, you need to consider your options.

You can either focus on three attributes until they are completely maxed out then pick three new ones, or you can focus on Endurance and rotate the other two. The second option is less boring and it's what I generally do.

## Skills

**FINALLY**, here are some tips for leveling specific skills.

### Combat

####Armorer

This one is a bit tricky as you need *a lot* of repair hammers, which can get expensive later on. Luckily, your shields and heavy armor are going to get damaged while you're leveling the other two Endurance skills, so you'll have something to repair. If you're also leveling strength, you'll have weapons to repair too.

But you will run out of things to use your hammers on, or you will run out of hammers. You may consider **training** (at The Fighting Chance in the Imperial City Market District), or you can **ignore** your Armorer skill until Heavy Armor and Block become painfully slow to level.

Tip: the *respawning* containers in the Market District often contain repair hammers. Actually
